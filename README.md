## üçé Planning Process

## üçé Features

##### As a user...
- I want to create a new account so that I can start my fitness journey
- I want to share some personal information such as my current weight, height, and activity level so that I can receive a recommended caloric intake
- I want to search for food items I've eaten so that I can log it into my journal
- I want to see the nutrition facts for what I've eaten so that I can monitor my daily intake
